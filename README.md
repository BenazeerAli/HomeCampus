HomeCampus Legacy Migration Project

Overview
This project involves the migration of the HomeCampus website from a deprecated Python 2 (Tipfy on Google App Engine) stack to a modern Python 3 environment using Flask. With the official end-of-life of Python 2, it became essential to upgrade the entire backend system to maintain security, performance, and long-term support.

Objectives

Migrate the existing HomeCampus application from Python 2.7 to Python 3.11+

Replace the Tipfy web framework (no longer maintained) with Flask, a widely-used and well-supported micro web framework

Ensure feature parity with the legacy system while modernizing the codebase

Improve maintainability, scalability, and developer experience

Technology Stack
Legacy → Migrated

Language: Python 2.7 → Python 3.11+

Framework: Tipfy → Flask

Templating: Jinja2 → Jinja2

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript → HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Deployment: Google App Engine → Flask local / GCP-ready

Key Tasks Completed

Codebase translation: Updated all Python 2-specific syntax and libraries (e.g., print, xrange, dict.iteritems) to Python 3 equivalents

Framework replacement: Migrated request handling, routing, sessions, and application structure from Tipfy to Flask

App structure refactor: Modularized the codebase into Flask blueprints and views for improved maintainability

Template updates: Updated Jinja2 templates for compatibility with Flask’s rendering system

Testing & debugging: Ensured functional parity and fixed issues that arose during migration

Deployment preparation: Made the app compatible with modern deployment environments

Skills & Concepts Applied

Flask application architecture and routing

WSGI-based web development

Templating with Jinja2

RESTful web service design

Frontend-backend integration

Legacy code migration and refactoring

Debugging and version control (Git)

Lessons Learned

Clean and modular architecture significantly simplifies legacy migrations

Gained hands-on experience with Flask’s ecosystem and its request-response lifecycle

Understood common challenges in Python 2 to 3 migrations

Reinforced best practices in debugging, testing, and modern web development

Future Improvements

Add automated testing using pytest or unittest

Introduce Docker for local development and containerized deployment

Implement role-based authentication and modern login mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2)

Upgrade the UI using modern frontend libraries like Bootstrap 5 or React
